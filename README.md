## Overview
Economic recessions and depressions are defined by the number of quarters U.S. GDP falls. Our project will analyze several macro-economic data sources to predict the GDP of the United States for a given quarter and subsequently predict whether a recession is likely. Our data sources include the [Bureau of Economic Analysis](https://www.bea.gov/), the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/), and [Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/). Our analysis is done in [iPython Jupyter Notebooks](https://ipython.org/notebook.html) using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

## Usage
1. We recommend running in a virtual environment like [VirtualEnv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)
2. Install dependencies with `$ pip install jupyter tensorflow sklearn scipy`
3. Navigate to this repository in the terminal andexecute `$ jupyter notebook`. It should open a web browser.
4. You can then open `dataCleaning.ipynb` or `basicModel.ipynb` to view and execute code.
