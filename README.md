## Overview
Economic recessions and depressions are defined by the number of quarters U.S. GDP falls. Our project will analyze several macro-economic data sources to predict the GDP of the United States for a given quarter and subsequently predict whether a recession is likely. Our data sources include the [Bureau of Economic Analysis](https://www.bea.gov/), the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/), and [Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/). Our analysis is done in [iPython Jupyter Notebooks](https://ipython.org/notebook.html) using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

## Usage

We recommend using in a virtual environment such as [VirtualEnv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)

```
# clone repository
git clone https://github.com/lduane2/ML-Final-Project.git
cd ML-Final-Project

# install dependencies (jupyter, tensorflow, pandas)
pip install -r requirement.txt

# run jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook

# navigate to dataCleaning.ipynb or basicModel.ipynb to view and execute code

```
